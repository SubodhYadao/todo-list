Hereâ€™s a basic structure for a README.md file for a FastAPI To-Do List application that uses MongoDB:
To-Do List App with FastAPI and MongoDB

A simple To-Do list application built with FastAPI and MongoDB as the database. This project demonstrates CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using RESTful APIs in Python, along with a NoSQL database integration.
Features

    Create a new to-do item
    Read all to-do items or a single item by ID
    Update a to-do item by ID
    Delete a to-do item by ID

Technologies Used

    FastAPI - A modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+.
    MongoDB - A NoSQL database for storing data in a flexible, JSON-like format.
    Motor - An async driver for MongoDB, designed for use with FastAPI.

Requirements

    Python 3.7+
    MongoDB

Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository

bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/todo-list-fastapi-mongodb.git
cd todo-list-fastapi-mongodb

2. Set Up the Virtual Environment

Create and activate a virtual environment for Python dependencies:

bash

# On Windows
python -m venv env
.\env\Scripts\activate

# On macOS and Linux
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate

3. Install Dependencies

Install the required packages using pip:

bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the root directory with the following content:

plaintext

MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017
DATABASE_NAME=todo_db

5. Start MongoDB

Ensure that MongoDB is running. By default, it will start on localhost:27017.
6. Run the Application

Start the FastAPI server:

bash

uvicorn main:app --reload

The app should now be running at http://127.0.0.1:8000.
API Endpoints
Method	Endpoint	Description
POST	/todos/	Create a new to-do item
GET	/todos/	Retrieve all to-do items
GET	/todos/{id}	Retrieve a to-do by ID
PUT	/todos/{id}	Update a to-do by ID
DELETE	/todos/{id}	Delete a to-do by ID
Example To-Do Item JSON

Each to-do item has the following structure:

json

{
  "id": "string",
  "title": "string",
  "description": "string",
  "completed": "boolean"
}

Running Tests

To run tests (if any are included), use:

bash

pytest
